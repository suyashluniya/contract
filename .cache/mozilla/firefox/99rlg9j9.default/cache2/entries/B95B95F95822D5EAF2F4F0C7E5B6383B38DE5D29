Your Sharing and Messaging Options</h2>\n\n<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>8.1 Opting Out of Promotional Communications</b></p>\n\n<p style="padding-left: 15px;">You can choose to opt out of receiving additional promotional e-mails from Bountysource\n  by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any such e-mail.

International Transfers</h2>\n\n<p>If you are visiting this website from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (the United\n  States), your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By\n  visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers</h2>\n\n<p>Our Website and Services may contain site links or advertisements from companies other than Bountysource that may\n  link to their own websites. For example, our Service works in conjunction with Repositories such as GitHub, but we\n  are not affiliated with these Repositories in any legal or corporate sense. We are not responsible for the privacy\n  practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your\n  information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.</p>\n\n<h2>11. Security of Your Information</h2>\n\n<p>Bountysource implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and\n  offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>\n\n<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.1 User account information is protected by the password each member uses to access\n  their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you\n  immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Bountysource\n  account, the Website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password.\n  When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual\n  currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>\n\n<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.2 While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our\n  Websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we\n  cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to\n  take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account\n  after use. If your social networks account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized use of your Bountysource\n  account, so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our\n  Websites, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@bountysource.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely\n  secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is\n  being transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we\n  have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<h2>12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice\n  on Bountysource.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you. We may supplement this\n  process by placing notices in our Services and on other Bountysource Websites. You should periodically check <a\n    target="_blank" href="https://www.bountysource.com">www.bountysource.com</a> and this privacy page for updates.\n</p>\n\n<h2>13. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>\n\n<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you\n  affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is\n  participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on our Website. If you do ask us to share your personal\n  information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that\n  specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a\n  continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do\n  not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our Websites.</p>\n\n<p>Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal information held about themselves. Your right of\n  access can be exercised in accordance with applicable law. Please submit any requests for access to your personal\n  data in writing to <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@bountysource.com</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>14.

IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT between you and BountySource Inc. ("<strong>Bountysource</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). By using the Bountysource.com website ("<strong>Site</strong>") or any of the Bountysource services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Terms of Service ("<strong>Agreement</strong>"). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not proceed with the registration process or use our Site or Service.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Overview</h3>\n<p>Bountysource is a platform for encouraging development in open-source projects by bringing together users and developers to solve existing development issues.   In this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>"<strong>Backers</strong>" are users that pay Bountysource to contribute to Fundraisers or Bounties.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Bounties</strong>" are cash rewards that Bountysource pays to Developers who first develop a successful Solution to an Issue.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Committers</strong>" are persons that are authorized to merge code into a Repository on behalf of an open-source project.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Developers</strong>" are users that try to develop Solutions and claim a Bounty, or who receive funds from Fundraisers for a particular goal.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Fundraisers</strong>" are fundraising campaigns for a particular defined goal. Any user can create a fundraiser for any purpose related to open source projects. There are two types:\n    <ul>\n      <li>"All or Nothing" Fundraisers (where the defined goal must be achieved before any cash is provided to the Developer).</li>\n      <li>"Flexible" Fundraisers (where 90% of all cash pledged is provided to the Developer, regardless of whether the goal is met).</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>"<strong>Issues</strong>" are features, bugs, development needs or other issues that are posted on Bountysource and are in need of an open source Solution.  Any User can define an Issue by posting the Issue on an issue tracking website such as GitHub or Bitbucket.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Repositories</strong>" are the applicable open source project\'s code repository.  Bountysource does not act as a Repository for any Solutions or open source code.</li>\n  <li>"<strong>Solutions</strong>" are an original creation by a Developer to try and solve a particular Issue on Bountysource.  Solutions are submitted to the applicable Repository and not directly to Bountysource. Persons authorized to accept and merge code will decide whether a Solution is accepted or not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Bounties</h3>\n<p>2.1 A Backer pays Bountysource to encourage the development of a successful Solution to an Issue.  Bountysource will then post the terms of the Bounty on the Bountysource.com website. Backers must provide their payment at the time they create a Bounty. Backers consent to Bountysource and its payments partners charging their payment card or other payment method for the amount of their payment. Bounties are nonrefundable. There is no additional fee for posting a Bounty. An updated description of fees is maintained on the Bountysource <a href="/fees">Fees Page</a>.</p>\n<p>2.2 Backers may create more than one Bounty on an Issue. Once a Bounty has been created, Backers may not decrease or cancel it.</p>\n<p>2.3 Bounties are nonrefundable.</p>\n<p>2.4 Bountysource will pay Bounties to the first Developer whose Solution is accepted.  Bountysource reserves the right (but is not obligated) to apportion Bounties if multiple Developers present Solutions simultaneously or if a Developer submits a partial Solution.</p>\n<p>2.5 Committers, Backers and Developers and other users should not take any action in reliance on having a successful Solution until the successful Solution has been accepted by a Committer.</p>\n<p>2.6 Developers should not take any action in reliance on having a Bounty awarded until Bountysource notifies them that they have the ability to withdraw and spend the money.</p>\n<p>2.7 Because of occasional failures of payments from Backers, Bountysource cannot guarantee the full receipt of the Bounty amount pledged minus fees.</p>\n<p>2.8 Bountysource and its payments partners will remove their fees before transmitting proceeds of a Bounty to Developers.</p>\n<p>2.9 Bountysource reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a Bounty at any time and for any reason. Bountysource is not liable for any damages as a result of any of those actions. Bountysource\'s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>\n<p>2.10 By participating in our Service, you agree that Bountysource\'s good faith decisions will be final and not grounds for claims or litigation. Bountysource shall not be liable to you, and you hereby release us from any and all claims, for any damages resulting from or in connection with of any such determinations. Bountysource\'s policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>\n<p>2.11 <strong>Submitting Solutions</strong>. Developers are responsible for properly submitting their proposed Solutions to the appropriate Repositories. Bountysource does not receive, process or review proposed Solutions. If you are a Developer, you represent, warrant and promise that any Solution provided by you or on your behalf is an original creation of yours, was prepared in accordance with the applicable open source license, and does not (directly or indirectly) infringe the intellectual property rights or other legal rights of any third party.</p>\n<p>2.12 <strong>Selection of Winning Solutions</strong>. The winning Solution will be selected by a Committer by merging code into their Repository. The first merged Solution wins the Bounty. You agree not to make claims against Bountysource or hold Bountysource responsible in connection with the determination of the winning Solution.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Fundraisers</h3>\n<p>3.1 <strong>Creation of Fundraisers</strong>. Any Bountysource user may initiate a Fundraiser, which is a financial goal to raise money for any open-source project, event or coding need. The user must provide all information requested by Bountysource, which will include (but not be limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fundraising goal (how much they wish to raise)</li>\n  <li>Description of the project and purpose (why are they raising money)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.2 <strong>Posting of Fundraisers</strong>. Upon the user\'s successful establishment of the Fundraiser, Bountysource will post the Fundraiser and encourage Backers to make pledges. Bountysource is not responsible for reviewing and approving the content of Fundraisers.  However, Bountysource reserves the right to cancel, modify or reject Fundraisers at any time.</p>\n<p>3.3 <strong>Types of Fundraisers</strong>. There are two types of Fundraisers:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>All-or-Nothing Fundraiser - Bountysource disburses funds if, and only if, the project\'s purpose has been met. If not, Bountysource returns 90% of funds to Backers.</li>\n  <li>Flexible Fundraiser - Bountysource disburses 90% of funds as they are received, regardless of whether the project\'s purpose has been met.  Backer payments to Bountysource are nonrefundable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.4 <strong>Rewards</strong>. Users that initiate a Fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to give rewards to Backers who financially support the Fundraiser. Users are solely responsible for providing any rewards that they offer in a fair, reasonable and timely manner. Bountysource is not responsible and assumes no liability for provision of rewards (unless expressly agreed in a writing signed by Bountysource).</p>\n<p>3.5 <strong>Use of Funds.</strong> Recipients of Fundraiser monies must apply all funds solely in ways that directly advance the stated project purpose. If requested by Bountysource, recipients must provide a complete and accurate accounting of the application of such funds. If Bountysource determines in good faith that funds have been misapplied or used contrary to the intent as expressed in this Agreement and in the applicable Bounty or Fundraiser posting, Bountysource may demand return of some or all of the funds, and recipients shall be obligated to repay such funds within three (3) business days of such demand.</p>\n\n<h3>4.

Your provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, your failure to promptly update information provided to Bountysource, or your failure to respond for over 7 calendar days to inquiries by Bountysource concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with your registration shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for termination of your account.</p>\n<p>4.2 <strong>Screen Name and Project Names</strong>. You must not select a screen name or project name that (i) is the name of another person, with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) is subject to any rights of another person, without appropriate authorization; or (iii) is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC)</h3>\n<p>Bountysource is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding Anti-Money Laundering ("AML"). Bountysource\'s AML Policy is to prevent people engaged in money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes, including terrorist financing, from using our services.</p>\n<p>As part of our AML procedures, during account opening or as part of our account review process, we collect information from Users to satisfy our Know Your Customer requirements. This means that we may request information from Users due to a specific identification requirement. We may ask Users to provide documentation to help confirm User\'s identity or provide additional information regarding User\'s business. We may also request that Users seek pre-approval for utilizing the Bountysource service if User\'s account falls within a high-risk compliance category.</p>\n<p>Bountysource\'s identity verification procedure requires the User to provide Bountysource with reliable, independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill) upon request. For such purposes Bountysource reserves the right to collect User\'s identification information for AML Policy purposes.</p>\n<p>Bountysource will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by the Users. All legal methods for double-checking identification information will be used and Bountysource reserves the right to investigate certain Users who have been determined to be risky or suspicious.</p>\n<p>Bountysource reserves the right to verify User\'s identity in an on-going basis, especially when their identification information has been changed or their activity seemed to be suspicious (unusual for the particular User). In addition, Bountysource reserves the right to request up-to-date documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity verification in the past.</p>\n<p>User\'s identification information will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the Bountysource\'s Privacy Policy and related regulations.</p>\n<p>Bountysource is entitled to interact with law enforcement, which are involved in prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activity.  If Bountysource suspects that a transaction is conducted for criminal money laundering or other illegal purposes, Bountysource reserves the right to report suspicious transactions to law enforcement\'s financial intelligence unit in the respective country.</p>\n<p>The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are) but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what they do). Therefore, Bountysource relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool.
